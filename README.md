## Overview
Working for PlanMyTrip, Jack loves the app that was created. Beta testers also love it too. Just like, every other new project, recommendations for changes have been requested. In this analysis, I will be adding the weather description to the weather data and have beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. I will finally finish off, using Google Maps Directions API, creating a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
